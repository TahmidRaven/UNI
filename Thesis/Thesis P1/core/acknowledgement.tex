We are also deeply and profoundly grateful to our supervisor, Dr. Md. Ashraful Alam, for his valuable support and encouragement during our work. His help was very much materialized any time we were in problems.

Not the least, special thanks go to our parents for their support whenever we needed them. Their consistent support and prayer have been a strength to us right through to this moment when we are about to graduate.
