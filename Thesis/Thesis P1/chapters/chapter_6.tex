Since cardiovascular diseases are one of the leading causes of death in this age, it is crucial to identify cardiac risks early and accurately. Application of deep learning and natural language processing based algorithms in a large and diverse dataset can develop a good cardiac risk prediction model which can be able to predict more accurately and efficiently than previous models. That is why our study seeks to develop a system that can better predict cardiac risks by combining unstructured data from EHRs with ECG signals after applying our dual deep learning-based model to it. By merging these two data sets, we intend to develop a model that can enhance risk assessments' accuracy and comprehensibility. This study shows how Natural Language Processing(NLP)  and deep learning(DL) can work together to improve cardiac risk prediction and provide medical professionals with a vital tool.
