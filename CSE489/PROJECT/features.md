Hello, assalamuwalikum. This is the demonstration of my app Pomokaijuu. It's a productivity
app. I've tried to implement the pomodoro methon in the app. It's basically a timer that 
let's the user focus for a certain amount of time to complete particular tasks. 

Here I've implemented firebase as backend and flutter with dart for the app's functionality and used
material design provided by flutter itself. 

To begin with I'm using firebase authentication for sign up and login
let's create a new user 
this is how we log in. (tasks email and password)
let's go back to firebase to see how it's working. 
back to the app. 
after successful login it will promt to the homepage where we see the pomokaijuu timer.

A user can set the timer to it's convenience. here they can set tasks. 
users will get rewarded for completion of tasks and by earned rewards. (users get points from rewars and completion of tasks)

Firestore handles the data and retreives the result for the user of highest points.
